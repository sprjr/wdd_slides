        <h1>About WDD_Slides</h1>
        <p>WDD_Slides is a project that has a few goals involved with its creation and existence. I wanted to create a lightweight application
        that was fully based in a cloud environment (e.g. everything created or developed from within a browser / web application).</p>
        <p>To do that I utilized (currently) <a href="http://www.cloud9ide.com/">Cloud9IDE</a>, CouchDB (hosted by <a href="http://www.cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a>)
        and <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>. This allowed me to develop my app simply, and still retain version control / easy open source sharing, as
        well as provide me with a dynamic content database for the project itself.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h1>The Second Part</h1>
        <p>The other part of this project was intended to pass on to future students in my degree program at <a href="http://www.fullsail.com/">Full Sail University</a>
        so that they could learn from my own failures and perhaps successes in the program. The degree itself (like any college) isn't cheap, and I wanted to be sure
        to maximize what I took away from it as well as what I could give back so others can benefit as well.</p>
        <p>I currently plan to implement a category / author sorting feature which should actually be quite easy to do, as well as an admin control panel to input new
        slide content into the Couch (however that is proving difficult to do with my current tech lockdown). Perhaps if a solution doesn't present itself I will break
        at least the "cloud only" rule and whip up a quick admin panel and shoot it off to Cloudant with a replicate and be done.

        <h1>The Author</h1>
        <p>My name is Stephen Rivas JR, I'm currently a 27 year old student who loves web development. I enjoy Javascript, CouchDB, minimalistic design, and learning
        new ways to solve problems.</p>
        <p>You can check out my works all over the internet as I sporadically post them about - although I hope to assemble them all on my own site which you can locate
        over at <a href="http://www.stephenrivasjr.com/">www.stephenrivasjr.com</a>.</p>
        <p>I also project manage / own a web studio called <a href="http://www.zeunic.com/">zeunic</a>, so check us out there as well!</p>
